# Heartbeat Checklist

This file controls what the agent checks during periodic heartbeat cycles.
Edit this list to add or remove checks. Leave empty to let the agent decide based on context.

## Default Checks

- Review pending tasks — are any overdue or stuck?
- Check recently completed tasks — any follow-up needed?
- Look at scheduled tasks — any coming up soon that need preparation?

## Custom Checks
<!-- Add your own checks below. The agent will run through this list during each heartbeat. -->
<!-- Examples: -->
<!-- - Check email for urgent messages -->
<!-- - Monitor stock prices for AAPL, GOOGL -->
<!-- - Check weather forecast for tomorrow -->
