# Workflow Patterns Reference

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Workflows

For complex tasks, break operations into clear, sequential steps. It is often helpful to give Claude an overview of the process towards the beginning of SKILL.md:

```
Filling a PDF form involves these steps:

1. Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
2. Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
3. Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
4. Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
5. Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

### Conditional Workflows

For tasks with branching logic, guide Claude through decision points:

```
1. Determine the modification type:
   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow: [steps]
3. Editing workflow: [steps]
```

## Key Recommendations

- **Sequential workflows**: Clearly outline step-by-step processes at the beginning of your SKILL.md documentation
- **Conditional workflows**: Use decision points and branching logic to guide Claude through different paths based on task requirements
- Both patterns help ensure Claude understands the overall process flow and can execute complex tasks systematically
